The purpose of this research is to create novel directions for the digital calendar and see what how they might have an effect on how users perceive time and events in a piecemeal way that would be near impossible on a physical calendar.

The reason for rethinking the digital calendar is because it was a direct copy of its physical counter part and I believe that there are more interesting avenues that event tracking can do in a way that has never been done before. I will be introducing a data format for the entries into the digital calendar that will make its organization cleaner and thus a user will be able to find information faster within the framework.
